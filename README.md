# Linux-Kernel-Development
This repository contains lab-work for Operating Systems Organization course at Washington University in Saint Louis. 
The assignments here emphasize on developing and applying skills and techniques for profiling, quantifying, and evaluating operating system behaviors based on an understanding of the policies and mechanisms that govern those behaviors.

The objectives of these assignments are:

- develop a solid base of knowledge about the Linux kernel and its user space libraries;
- employ existing kernel and user space mechanisms to implement different capabilities in C programs;
- review principles underpinning how different kernel and user space mechanisms behave; and
- design and apply mechanisms based on those principles to gauge and demonstrate understanding of them.
